                <h1>The Midnight Madness Project</h1>
                <h2>What is Midnight Madness?</h2>
                <p>Midnight madness is a film screening programme part of the Toronto International Film Festival, or TIFF,
                    consisting of a selection of action, horror, science fiction, and fantasy cinema. In other words, genre film.</p>
                <p>At my first TIFF, I fell in love with Midnight 
                    Madness. The movies reminded me of those I would 
                    watch with my friends at sleepovers, and the 
                    midnight screening time certainly added to that.
                    The films were some of the most fun, most
                    adventurous of the festival and I was instantly 
                    captivated.</p>
                <p>After returning home from Toronto, I was eager 
                    to dive into the history of the festival, in 
                    hopes of finding similar films to enjoy. To my 
                    surprise, there was a lack of organized information 
                    on not only the history of Midnight Madness, but also 
                    the history of TIFF itself. I sought out to fill this gap 
                    in the recording of Midnight Madness history, as well as to create
                    an online and readily available resource for those who, like me, are 
                    interested in finding out more information about one of TIFF's most colorful programmes.</p>
                <h2>Enter: The Project</h2>
                <p>My goals for this project are threefold:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>To create a searchable database of all the films shown in the history of Midnight Madness at TIFF.</li>
                    <li>To provide a space for fans of the programme to learn more about the films they love.</li>
                    <li>To create an online resource for Midnight Madness related scholarship.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Methods</h2>
