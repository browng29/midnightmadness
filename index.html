			<h1>Welcome to Midnight Madness...</h1>
			<p>Midnight.</p>
			<p>Toronto.</p>
			<p>10 nights a year.</p>
			<p>Midnight madness is a film screening programme part of the Toronto International Film Festival, or TIFF, consisting of a selection of the best action, horror, science fiction, and fantasy cinema. It provides a space for the weird and wacky, the shocking, and the gruesome and gory. </p>
			<p>A number of films selected for the programme have gone on to receive critical acclaim, cult followings, and, of course, enthusiastic audience appraisal, good or bad. My goal was to make a website that has a searchable database of all the films shown at Midnight Madness at TIFF, as there is a noticeable gap in resources like this. I hope to provide a space for fans of the programme to learn more about the films they love, and for those who are new to the programme to learn more about the films that have been shown in the past.</p>
			<p>I am excited to learn more about web design as well as digital scholarship over the course of this project.</p>
